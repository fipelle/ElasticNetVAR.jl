Tests:

I could use the solution provided on Julia Lang
- Is ecm_new replacing settings? (not the main ones since the results are correct)
- Is validation_new replacing settings?

And then focus on the below
- Is validation_new running without errors?
- Is validation_new faster / as fast as validation.jl?
